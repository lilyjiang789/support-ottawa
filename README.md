# Support Ottawa
## Inspiration

This project was inspired by an interaction a group member had with a woman in need at the bus stop. 

From that we discovered that a huge problem in the community of homeless people and people in need is disconnection, whether its between people supporting help, services providing assistance or with each other.

Thus we decided to build this platform to form a connected community even for those in need! 

## What it does

1. **Smart Shelter Distribution** â€“ Our platform maps homeless individuals to available shelter spaces, ensuring fair distribution and reducing overcrowding.

2. **Real-Time Shelter Updates** â€“ Shelter managers can update availability and status in real-time, making sure no bed goes unused.

ðŸ”¹ Community Engagement & Assistance â€“ We empower kind-hearted individuals to announce charitable acts, such as meal distributions, clothing drives, or free services.

ðŸ”¹ Partnerships with Local Organizations â€“ We collaborate with food banks, shelters, and outreach programs to enhance support and ensure sustainable aid.

ðŸ”¹ Access to Essential Services â€“ Users can find nearby food banks, medical clinics, job opportunities, and support programs through our interactive resource map.

ðŸ”¹ Volunteer & Donation Hub â€“ People can sign up to volunteer, donate items, or offer services, making it easier to contribute in a meaningful way.
